# 🌐 korolkov.github.io — Personal Engineering Portfolio

A clean, fast, modern React + Vite–powered personal site showcasing my work in **backend engineering**, **AI automation**, and **cloud-native architecture**.  
This repo contains the entire source code for my portfolio hosted on **GitHub Pages** at **https://korolkov.pro**.

The goal: keep everything **simple, blazing-fast, and production-ready**, while reflecting the tools and principles I use in real engineering work.
