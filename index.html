				<h2>How did I come to programming?</h2>
				<p>I was born in Ukraine. I grew up in a large family. I have 4 native siblings and 3 step-siblings. I think it is a really
					big team.</p>

				<p>In my childhood, I read a lot. At school, I’d first encountered the information technology. When I was 11 and I was still
					in the 5th grade, I wrote my first program in Basic. After school, I devoted a long time studying electronics and physics
					at the Moscow University. Then I’d first encountered the development of devices based microcontrollers and the hardware
					level programming them using such programming languages ​​as Assembler, C, Delphi, Pascal, Fortran, and others. But
					my vocation I found only after successfully graduated from the university. Working as a system administrator in a big
					company, I had firstly known about web technologies and web programming. It was 2005 and at that moment I realized my
					future is the Internet.</p>
				<p>I created my first website for the company where I worked then I moved to another major city where I had begun as a web
					programmer in Leader-group company. At the time my technologies were PHP, CSS and HTML.</p>
				<p>This was only the beginning. After one year I already worked in an international US company “Global Logic”, was a member
					of the research group within the university and one year later I had created an application that was used in 80 countries
					of the world.</p>
				<p>Many years have passed since that time but I’ve understood one thing, what been a dream in 2005, now it's a reality.</p>
